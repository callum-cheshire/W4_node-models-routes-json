Examine existing code to find out what needs adding

We need:
  To build out each function in the recipes.js file in the models folder
  To build an endpoint that uses each of those functions to perform the appropriate action
  To use app.use in the app.js file to route the request into the routes folder and apply the appropriate method based on the endpoint 

Build a get request in the recipes.js file in the routes folder
  Use recipesRouter.get and then an asyncfunction with req, res
  Declare a variable and assign it to the await getQuotes function
  Respond to the request with the variable just declared -> res.json(variable)

Build out the getRecipes function
  Use await fetch to accces the json database and declare a variable to store the response
  Declare another variable to access and store the parsed json data we want from the returned database
  Return
